# Alexa with Typescript!!

The editable files are inside of `lambda`. If you want to transpile Typescript into Javascript you can do `npm run build` and a new folder `dist` will be created. You can deploy the skill by doing `npm run deploy`, this will transpile the project, create a new commit and push on the master branch.

If you don't want to fight with Typescript you can also use Javascript files.
